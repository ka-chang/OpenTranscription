# Design Specifications

- User uploads a file
- OT provides details about the file and checks if it can be converted to work with OpenSpeech
- OT is happy and allows users to proceed. OT is not happy and directs users to contact developer with their file details so that functionality can be added (this will take time so sharing details does not guarantee compatiability)
- OT asks user if they'd like to proceed with file conversion and transcription. Provides a time estimate on the transcription process based on file type and length
- OT transcribes, includes progress bar and warning signs (do not put computer to sleep, do not close window)
- OT spits out the transcription and asks users to review
- User saves the transcript to their local drive
- OT provides other resources for next steps (OTranscribe for cleaning). Also provides warning on accuracy and limitations of quality.
- Thanks for using OT!
