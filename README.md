A friendly speech-to-text transcriber built for everyone. OpenTranscription uses an open source speech-to-text engine to process any audio file to text, with no fees and minimal technical expertise required.

## Status

Current conducting user interviews. Reach out through kachang@uw.edu if you're interested in speaking with me on this project.

## Background 

Paid audio transcription (e.g., Rev.com) services are often price prohibitive for the average student processing interview and focus group audio. Instead, students will often hand transcribe their audio from scratch, which is often tedious and time-intensive. While there is significant value in listening through audio data to better conceptualize themes and emergent findings, there are much more efficient ways to transcribe audio recordings without losing human-checked accuracy.

There are open-source automated transcription tools and low-cost speech-to-text tools that help address the cost barrier inherent in this space. However, these tools often require a level of technical expertise that creates its own challenges for widespread adoption.

OpenTranscription is an open source (free) speech-to-text transcriber tool intended for users with minimal technical background. OpenTranscription is designed through an easy to use graphical user interface that will processed audio files locally on a user's machine to generate an automated text transcript. In most cases, human cleaning will still be required for ensure accuracy, but a user's average starting point will be much improved compared to starting from scratch. 

## Users

Students (undergraduate, graduate) and researchers with limited institutional resources
